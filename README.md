# algorithms sedgwick 1983
In this project, I will be systematically reading 
and implementing all algorithms from Robert 
Sedgewick's 1983 work "Algorithms." I will use 
C++17, since it balances low-level control with 
'off-the-shelf' data structures. I will post to 
this repository five out of every seven days 
until I've finished the book. 

# sections

Sedgwick's book is divided into sections of chapters.
The sections are:
- Mathetmatical Algorithms
- Sorting Algorithms
- Searchin Algorithms
- String Processing Algorithms
- Geometric Algorithms
- Graph Algorithms
- Advanced Topics

First, I will read and implement the first chapter of 
each section (BFS), then I will read and implement the 
rest of each section in order from front to back (DFS).
This will give me broad knowledge first, and then 
introduce more of the complexities in each field over 
time.

I expect the introductory 'DFS' stage to take about a 
week and a half, and each section after that to take
about a week. This means I will plan on being done in
eight weeks, or in the first week of July 2022.
